1. read `README.md` in `character-faster-rcnn`
2. read `README.md` in `word-faster-rcnn`
3. read `README.md` in `evaluation`
4.a) To use `character-faster-rcnn` compute the outputs for all files in the dataset (not just the test.txt). The best way to do this is to merge `train.txt` and `test.txt` in `character-faster-rcnn\DataGeneration\`
4.b) generate images with all overlapping annotations and send them to `word-faster-rcnn\DataGeneration\maps\`.
