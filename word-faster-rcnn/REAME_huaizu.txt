Adapt the original py-faster-rcnn repository to fine tune a pre-trained imagenet model for face detection.

Usage:
	sh ./experiments/scripts/faster-rcnn_end2end.sh 1 VGG16 ijba

Added files:
	lib/datasets/face.py 							It defines a class to read face data.
	lib/datasets/factory.py 						It supports of getting face imdb.
	experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_end2end.sh 		Added support for face data.
	models/face/VGG16/*.prototxt					Caffe solvers, train and test prototxts.

To train a faster-rcnn face detection model on another dataset, you only need to modify first three files. 
1. For face.py, you have to tell it the paths of training images and their ground-truth annotations. In the current implementation, all these information are read from a txt file with the FDDB format. Please refer to /data2/hzjiang/Data/CS2/IJBA_detection/spli1/train_1_annot.txt for more details. In the code, you might need to read __init__(), _load_image_set_index(), and gt_roidb().

2. In factory.py, you instantiate an instance of a face dataset like this:
	ijba_devkit_path = '/data2/hzjiang/Data/CS2'
	for split in xrange(0, 10):
		name = 'ijba_train_split_%d' % split
		__sets[name] = (lambda split = split: face('train', split, ijba_devkit_path))

3. In faster_rcnn_end2end.sh, you need to add support of your dataset in "case $DATASET".
